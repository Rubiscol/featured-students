This is an official implementation for our paper "Featured students: How to enforce models behave more differently in medical 
anomaly". The code will be released once accepted.

An overview of our featured students:

The model undergoing training is referred to as a junior student, while models that have completed training are considered senior students. Under the explicit constraint, a junior student learns from an intermediate feature path distinct from all its seniors. During the inference phase, a gradient-guided discrepancy integrates both forward and backward information into the discrepancy calculation.
